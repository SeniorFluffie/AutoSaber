## Background Information
Information regarding mapping terminology can be found on the [Beat Saber Modding Group Page](https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/glossary.html).

## Dataset
[BeastSaber](https://bsaber.com/) and [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com/) are the two most popular unofficial beatmap distributors. It is believed that BeatSaver is the actual host of the songs and both websites link to that back-end. As of January 2021, the maintainers of the site have disabled APIs to avoid abuse from individuals scraping the dataset. To get around this, the following [dataset was used for this project](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1WsTE8SrZs4LdBKLBhwSGz5t4Lw7X5JvH).
